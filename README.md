# Ghost Pavilion API
https://fierce-hollows-84409.herokuapp.com/

The api for the Ghost Pavilion app was created with Node JS. It uses a database with tables for the shows and the subscribers. The api uses Express, Morgan, CORS and Knex. For testing I used supertest and mocha.

There is currently no authentication.
